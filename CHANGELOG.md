## [1.2.2] - 2025-05-17

### Fixed

- **Build Process & Documentation**:
  - Resolved `tsc` build errors related to `rootDir` conflicts by adjusting `tsconfig.json` to include only `src/**/*` for the main build.
  - Fixed TypeDoc warnings for script files (`scripts/*.ts`) not being under `rootDir` by:
    - Creating `tsconfig.typedoc.json` with `rootDir: "."` and including both `src` and `scripts`.
    - Updating the `docs:generate` script in `package.json` to use `tsconfig.typedoc.json`.
  - Corrected TSDoc comments in script files (`scripts/clean.ts`, `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts`, `scripts/make-executable.ts`, `scripts/tree.ts`) by removing non-standard `@description` block tags, resolving TypeDoc warnings.

### Changed

- **Configuration & Deployment**:
  - **Dockerfile**: Set default `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE` to `http` and exposed port `3010` for containerized deployments.
  - **Smithery**: Updated `smithery.yaml` to allow Smithery package users to configure `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE`, `MCP_HTTP_PORT`, and `MCP_LOG_LEVEL`.
  - **Local Development**: Adjusted `mcp.json` to default to HTTP transport on port `3010` for local server execution via MCP CLI.

- Updated `src/mcp-server/server.ts`, `src/mcp-server/transports/httpTransport.ts`, `src/index.ts`, and `src/utils/security/rateLimiter.ts` to consistently use the validated configuration object from `src/config/index.ts` instead of accessing `process.env` directly.
- Changed the default HTTP port (`MCP_HTTP_PORT`) from 3000 to 3010 in the configuration.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-01

This release focuses on integrating API documentation generation, enhancing the HTTP transport layer, and refining server initialization and logging.

- **API Documentation & Build**: Integrated TypeDoc for automated API documentation generation. Added `typedoc.json` configuration and a `docs:generate` script to `package.json`. Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the generated `docs/api/` directory and refreshed `README.md` and `docs/tree.md`. (Commit: `b1e5f4d` - approx, based on sequence)
- **MCP Types & Server Initialization**: Removed redundant local MCP type definitions (`src/types-global/mcp.ts`, `src/types-global/tool.ts`), relying on the SDK types. Refactored the main server entry point (`src/index.ts`) to initialize the logger _after_ configuration loading and used an async IIFE for startup. Improved JSDoc clarity in server, resource, and tool registration files. (Commit: `0459112`)
- **HTTP Transport & Logging Enhancements**:
  - Added stricter security headers (CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy) to HTTP responses.
  - Improved logging detail within the HTTP transport for origin checks, session handling, port checks, and request flow.
  - Made logger initialization asynchronous and added conditional console logging (active only when `MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug` and stdout is a TTY).
  - Implemented a workaround for an SDK `isInitializeRequest` check issue in the HTTP transport.
  - Changed the default HTTP port from 3000 to 3010.
  - Enhanced port conflict detection with proactive checks before binding.
  - Cleaned up minor logging inconsistencies. (Commit: `76bf1b8`)
