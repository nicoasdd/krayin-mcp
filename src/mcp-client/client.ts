/**
 * Creates, connects, and returns an MCP client instance for a specified server.
 *
 * This function orchestrates the entire lifecycle of an MCP client connection:
 * 1.  **Cache Check**: Verifies if an active connection to the `serverName` already exists in the
 *     `connectedClients` cache. If so, the existing `ConnectedMcpClient` instance is returned.
 * 2.  **Configuration Validation**: Retrieves and validates the server's configuration from `mcp-config.json`
 *     via `getMcpServerConfig`. This step is crucial to ensure the server is known and properly
 *     configured before attempting a connection. Throws `McpError` if configuration is missing or invalid.
 * 3.  **Client Identity & Capabilities Definition**: Constructs the client's identity (name, version) and
 *     declares its capabilities (e.g., support for listing resources, calling tools) as per the
 *     MCP 2025-03-26 specification. This information is sent to the server during the `initialize` handshake.
 * 4.  **Transport Acquisition**: Obtains the appropriate communication transport (Stdio or HTTP) for the
 *     target server using `getClientTransport`, based on the validated server configuration.
 * 5.  **Client Instantiation**: Creates a new `Client` instance from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`,
 *     providing the defined client identity and capabilities.
 * 6.  **Event Handler Setup**: Attaches `onerror` and `onclose` event handlers to both the `Client` instance
 *     and its underlying transport. These handlers are responsible for logging errors, managing connection
 *     state, and triggering the `disconnectMcpClient` function for cleanup.
 * 7.  **Connection and Initialization**: Invokes `client.connect(transport)` to establish the physical
 *     connection to the server and perform the MCP `initialize` handshake. This is an asynchronous
 *     operation that resolves upon successful initialization.
 * 8.  **Connection Caching**: Upon successful connection and initialization, the new `ConnectedMcpClient`
 *     instance is stored in the `connectedClients` cache for future reuse.
 *
 * @param serverName - The unique name of the MCP server to connect to. This name must correspond
 *                     to an entry in the `mcp-config.json` file.
 * @param parentContext - Optional. A parent `RequestContext` for maintaining logging and tracing continuity.
 *                        If not provided, a new root context is created.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the connected and initialized `ConnectedMcpClient` instance.
 * @throws {McpError} If server configuration is missing or invalid, if the transport cannot be established,
 *                    or if the connection or MCP initialization handshake fails. Other errors may be
 *                    thrown if unexpected issues occur.

/**
 * Disconnects a specific MCP client, closes its transport, and removes it from the cache.
 * This function is designed to be idempotent; calling it multiple times for an already
 * disconnected client will not cause errors.
 *
 * The disconnection process involves:
 * 1.  Retrieving the client from the `connectedClients` cache. If not found, it logs a warning
 *     (unless an error triggered the disconnect) and exits.
 * 2.  If an `error` parameter is provided (indicating an error-triggered disconnect),
 *     the client is immediately removed from the cache to prevent further use of a potentially
 *     unstable client.
 * 3.  The `client.close()` method is called. This method from the SDK attempts a graceful shutdown,
 *     which may include sending a 'shutdown' notification to the server (depending on protocol version
 *     and capabilities) and then closes the underlying transport.
 * 4.  Any errors occurring during the `client.close()` operation are caught and logged. The process
 *     continues to the `finally` block regardless of `close()` success or failure.
 * 5.  In the `finally` block, a check is performed to ensure the client is removed from the cache
 *     if it hasn't been already (e.g., if the disconnect was not error-triggered or if an error
 *     occurred during the `close()` operation itself).
 *
 * @param serverName - The name of the server whose client connection should be terminated.
 * @param parentContext - Optional. A parent `RequestContext` for logging and tracing continuity.
 * @param error - Optional. The error that triggered the disconnect, if any. This is used
 *                for logging the reason for disconnection and for guiding immediate cache removal.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the disconnection attempt is complete.
